This note describes the ROOT tree making process implemented by Nick Kinnaird for his Ratio Analysis. He explained the process to me on June 30, 2020 and this is my documentation of his explanation. The goal of making the ROOT trees is to take the output of the Production chain, which produces an art ROOT file, and convert it into a more useful form for the Ratio Analysis. To that end, this note describe the process of taking the data products in the art ROOT file, specifically the clusterArtRecords dataproducts, and converting them into a ROOT TTree.
