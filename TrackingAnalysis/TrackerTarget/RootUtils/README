g-2 Root style
=======================================================================

This package contains the following files:

- gm2Style.C: it contains the actual style definition. You can call it
  from any macro by adding the following line near the top of the macro
  (this line is not required if it is included in your rootlogon.C):

  #include "gm2Style.C"

  and then invoking the style function with:

  SetGm2Style();

- gm2Style.py: example of python wrapper for gm2Style.C, in case
  you prefer to use pyROOT.

- rootlogon.C: automatically loads the g-2 style. Put in your
  working directory together with gm2Style.C, and you'll get the
  g-2 style loaded by default any time you launch ROOT in that
  directory.

- dot.rootrc: this is an example of the .rootrc file you could put in
  you home directory to get the g-2 style loaded any time you launch
  ROOT from any location, without having to copy the style file
  around. It contains the following lines:

  Unix.*.Root.DynamicPath:    .:$(ROOTSYS)/lib:$(HOME)/RootUtils/lib:
  
  This one tells ROOT where to look for libraries. It points to the
  current directory (.), the standard ROOT library location
  ($(ROOTSYS)/lib), and a custom location ($(HOME)/RootUtils/lib) that
  you should change to fit your needs.

  Unix.*.Root.MacroPath:      .:$(HOME)/RootUtils:

  This one tells root where to look for macros. It points to the
  current directory (.) and to a custom location ($(HOME)/RootUtils)
  that you should change to fit your needs.

  $(HOME)/RootUtils (or whatever is the name of your custom macro
  repository) is where you should put both your 'rootlogon.C' and
  'gm2Style.C' files in order to get the g-2 style loaded by
  default without copying them around.

- gm2Utils.C and gm2Labels.C: useful utility packages, containing several function
  definitions, like the one to generate the g-2 label. You can load
  them by including the following lines near the top of your macro:
  
  #include "gm2Utils.C"
  #include "gm2Labels.C"

  The files should be in you working directory, or in your custom macro
  repository defined in your .rootrc file, where you also should have
  put the gm2Style.C file. In this case, you can safely load them from
  anywhere.

- gm2Utils.py: example of python wrapper for gm2Utils.C, in case
  you prefer to use pyROOT.

- gm2Example.C and nlofiles.root will produce an example plot. Just copy
  them in the directory with all the other style and utility files,
  and execute the macro. Enter root and do:
  
  .x gm2Example.C

  If you setup your .rootrc file and your custom macro repository, in
  order to produce the example plots (gm2Example.eps,
  gm2Example.png, gm2Example.pdf) you will just need gm2Example.C and
  nlofiles.root.
